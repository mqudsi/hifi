HiFi is a head and foot injection plugin. It allows you to inject code into the head and foot areas of your posts and pages on a per-page basis.

== Description ==

HiFi is a head injection and foot injection plugin (or head include, foot include, head insert, foot insert, what ever you want to call it). It basically allows you to inject `<script>`, `<style>`, `<meta>` and any other code you want into the head and foot areas of your posts and pages. The code injected is page-specific, this means that only the pages you want code inserted into will be affected.

This plugin is most useful when you have specific functionality that needs to be added on a per-post/page basis.
